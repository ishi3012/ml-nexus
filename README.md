## Overview
The **ML-Nexus** repository is designed to demonstrate machine learning proficiency by implementing algorithms from scratch and deploying them using modern tools like Docker, Flask/FastAPI, and CI/CD pipelines.

Key Features:
- Algorithms implemented from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Pandas.
- Deployment of models via APIs, Docker, and cloud services.
- Unit tests to ensure robustness.
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the repository on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ishi3012/ml-nexus
    cd ml-nexus

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run unit tests:**
   ```bash
    pytest

## Algorithms

**Folder Structure:**
- classification/: KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.
- regression/: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.
- clustering/: K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.
- dimensionality_reduction/: PCA, LDA, etc.

***Each algorithm folder contains:***
- Algorithm Explanation: Detailed breakdown of the theory behind the algorithm.
- Step-by-Step Implementation: Python code implementing the algorithm from scratch.
- Examples and Visualizations: Example applications and visual outputs.

## Deployment
Explore how to deploy these algorithms in real-world settings:

- api/: Flask/FastAPI-based model deployment.
- cloud/: Integrating models with AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
- docker/: Dockerizing ML applications for portability.
- CI-CD/: Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate model deployment.

## Notebooks
Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrate:

- Algorithm implementations on various datasets.
- Step-by-step walk-throughs with visualizations.
- Flexibility in applying models to different data.

## Tests
Unit tests for all algorithms and deployment pipelines:

- Implemented using pytest.
- Ensures the correctness and reliability of the code.

## Core Features

- Algorithm Implementation: Every algorithm is implemented from scratch with detailed explanations and comparison to scikit-learn’s results.
- Preprocessing Module: Utilities like StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and LabelEncoder are implemented to preprocess data.
- Evaluation Metrics: Custom implementations of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and MSE, compared with sklearn metrics.

## Advanced Features

- Model Pipelines: Implement model pipelines to chain preprocessing and model steps like in sklearn.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Manual implementations of Grid Search and Randomized Search for parameter optimization.
- Cross-Validation: Custom cross-validation logic, as well as usage of sklearn’s cross-validation functions.

## Deployment Practice

- Flask/FastAPI: REST APIs that take in data and return predictions.
- Docker: Dockerizing ML applications for easy deployment.
- CI/CD: Automate deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Documentation & Visualization

- Documentation is provided for every algorithm and module using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs.
- Visualization in Jupyter notebooks to explain each step of the algorithms and show dataset results.

## Best Practices

- Code Quality: flake8 or pylint used to maintain code quality.
- Version Control: Track model versions using DVC or Git.
- Modular Code: Clear separation of concerns for maintainable and scalable code.

## Project Example
- Logistic Regression Classification Pipeline:
- Preprocessing: Standardize and encode input data.
- Model Building: Implement logistic regression from scratch and compare results with scikit-learn.
- Model Evaluation: Use accuracy and confusion matrix to evaluate the model.
- Deployment: Create a REST API to serve predictions.
- Dockerization: Dockerize the model and deploy it via API.
